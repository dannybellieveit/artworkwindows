# artworkwindows

Static web page that showcases artwork thumbnails inside a nostalgic
Windowsâ„¢-95 style interface. A Start menu opens the gallery window and
the window itself can be dragged around the teal desktop. Artwork images
and metadata are loaded at runtime from the [artwork-snake](https://github.com/dannybellieveit/artwork-snake)
repository so no binary assets are stored here.
